## 2022-12-25 -- Merry Chistmas, everyone!

One Day after christmas Eve, i'm happy to announce a new version of Lenic: Lenic 0.2-3

I wish everybody merry christmas. Especially to all people, who have to live in regions, where war takes place right now. War is maybe the most terrible thing on earth and everybody has to remember that those, who don't have the resposebilities for starting a war are those, who have the most consequences of it: the civilists.
